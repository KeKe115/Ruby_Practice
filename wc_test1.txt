m? Nobody knows exactly, but recent research by scientists is providing some important clues. Researchers at the University of Chicago, for example, have been studying a kind of songbird called the zebra finch. Each of these birds has its own unique song. These songs are very important because they help the birds mark their own territory and attract partners. Young zebra finches first copy the songs of other birds, and then they add on new parts to make their own song slightly different. Now new evidence has shown that at least one part of this creative process may take place when the birds are dreaming.
The scientists at the University of Chicago connected electronic wires to the heads of the songbirds so that they could record brain activity. They found that when the birds were awake and singing, their brains showed a particular pattern of activity. The scientists were then surprised to discover that the brains showed a similar pattern when the birds were sleeping. They reached the conclusion that the birds were in fact practicing and developing their songs in their dreams. Because the patterns at night were slightly different from the patterns during the day, it is believed that the birds were not just repeating the songs in their dreams but actually changing them. The scientists think that perhaps humans do something similar in their dreams.
This idea is supported by other research. Research on rats shows that they have similar patterns of brain activity both when they are asleep and when they are awake finding their way through mazes.ï¼Š And research on people shows that when people play a certain computer game during the day, they often dream about the same game at night. Furthermore, people often get better at the game after a night's sleep. All of this suggests that at least one function of dreams may be to help people organize their thoughts and memories in order to improve skills that have been learned during the day. The day when we at last understand the function of dreams may not be too far away.
